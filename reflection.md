For Project 02, I created a personal portfolio website using only basic HTML. I chose a cooking theme because it reflects my interests and made the project more enjoyable to work on. This project helped me understand how websites were built before CSS and JavaScript by using tables, colors, and images for layout and design. One challenge was making the site look organized without modern styling tools, but I learned how careful structure and content placement can improve readability. Overall, this project helped strengthen my understanding of HTML and website organization.
